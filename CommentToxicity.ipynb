      "    transforms a batch of strings (one example = one string) into either a list\n",
      "    of token indices (one example = 1D tensor of integer token indices) or a\n",
      "    dense representation (one example = 1D tensor of float values representing\n",
      "    data about the example's tokens). This layer is meant to handle natural\n",
      "    language inputs. To handle simple string inputs (categorical strings or\n",
      "    pre-tokenized strings) see `tf.keras.layers.StringLookup`.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The vocabulary for the layer must be either supplied on construction or\n",
      "    learned via `adapt()`. When this layer is adapted, it will analyze the\n",
      "    dataset, determine the frequency of individual string values, and create a\n",
      "    vocabulary from them. This vocabulary can have unlimited size or be capped,\n",
      "    depending on the configuration options for this layer; if there are more\n",
      "    unique values in the input than the maximum vocabulary size, the most\n",
      "    frequent terms will be used to create the vocabulary.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The processing of each example contains the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "    1. Standardize each example (usually lowercasing + punctuation stripping)\n",
      "    2. Split each example into substrings (usually words)\n",

      "       `[[\"string to split\"], [\"another string to split\"]]`, the Callable will\n",
      "       see `[\"string to split\", \"another string to split\"]`. The callable should\n",
      "       return a Tensor with the first dimension containing the split tokens -\n",
